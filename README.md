## Safety & Privacy Information (For IT Staff)

### Security

- **Single self-contained file** - The entire application is in one HTML file with no external dependencies
- **No network requests** - After initial load, makes zero network requests
- **No data transmission** - All exam data is stored locally in the browser's localStorage only
- **No tracking or analytics** - Does not include any tracking, analytics, or telemetry code
- **Client-side only** - Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with no backend server required

### Browser Requirements

- Works in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Requires JavaScript to be enabled
- Uses standard Web APIs:
  - `localStorage` for saving exam data between sessions
  - Screen Wake Lock API (optional, for preventing screensaver)

### Data Storage

All exam information (references, subjects, times) is stored in the browser's localStorage on the device. This means:

- Data never leaves the device
- Data is specific to that browser on that device
- Clearing browser data will reset the application
- No server, database, or cloud storage is involved

### Permissions

The application may request one optional permission:

- **Screen Wake Lock** - Prevents the screen from sleeping during exams. This is requested automatically when the page loads but can be toggled off by the user.

## How to Use

### First Time Setup

1. Download or copy the `index.html` file to your device
2. Open it in a web browser (double-click the file, or right-click > Open With > Browser)
3. The application will load with default settings for Marlborough Science Academy

### Configuring Settings

1. Click the **gear icon** (‚öôÔ∏è) in the bottom left corner
2. Update the following if needed:

   - **Centre Number** - Your exam centre number
   - **Primary Color** - Main color for headers
   - **Secondary Color** - Color for extra time information
3. Click **Save Settings**

### Adding Exams

   - **Extra Time** - Tick if extra time is allowed, specify minutes if different from 25%
3. Click **Save Exam**

**Note:** After adding your first exam, subsequent exams will automatically use the same start time (since most exams in a room start together). You can change this if needed.

  - Centre name and number (top)
  - Table of exams with reference, subject, start time, and finish time

### Display Controls

- Changes apply to all text on the screen for better readability

## Troubleshooting

### Q: The screen is still going to sleep

- Check that the üí° icon is green
- Try clicking it to turn it off and on again
- Some browsers or devices may not support the Wake Lock API - in this case, adjust your device's sleep settings manually

### Q: My exams disappeared

- Exams are saved in browser storage. If you clear your browser data/cookies, the exams will be deleted
- Use the download button (üíæ) to backup your exam schedule before clearing browser data
- Make sure you're using the same browser and not in private/incognito mode

### Q: The colors are wrong

- Click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) and adjust the Primary and Secondary colors in settings

### Q: Text is too small/large

- The text size is responsive and adjusts to screen size automatically
- Try full-screen mode (usually F11 key) or adjust your browser zoom (Ctrl/Cmd +/-)
